<!-- Why such a template?
  Most of the template generators are based on some technology for content replacement. It is much harder to define
  a generic document with only HTML knowledge. The goal of this approach is to let use html experience to create some
  general, exemplary document, filled with random content and then reuse it for generating similar pages filled with
  content derived from human readable format - in our case it would be the reStructuredText format (*.rst files).

  The HTML language separates data from the way of rendering it using the CSS style sheets. However in most cases it is
  not sufficient separation of concern, as the data stored in html document is very hard to read and edit. What is more
  it is also hard to reuse the data for different purposes. Therefor it is more suitable to keep pure data
  (text, pictures, links) in separate, easy to read, format and then place this content in appropriate locations on the
  website. We might come up with simple translator from rst to html, but it would enforce prescribed structure of the
  document. Usually we need to be more flexible, it will be often required to redesign the page structure, while the
  content data would remain the same.

  The advantage of this approach is to have a template file that can be itself displayed in the web-browser improving
  prototyping time. The regular css files would be applicable in the same way as it is with regular html page.

  The content rst files might contain more content than it would be rendered, as the *.html template would decide what
  to use. If the content would be missing some data required by the template the warning will be prompted and random
  data will be placed as a placeholder.

<!-- Conversion idea: RST -> XML -> HTML
 The "docutils" python package serves tools for generating html from rst directly. It also let use use custom document
 inspection for writing own generator. We might end up with having such a code that would convert rst to html using
 docutils parser and describe here html template. However our data, written in the *.rst file would still be very hard
 to process by other clients. Therefor I've decided to add intermediate step during conversion. The *.rst file will
 be converted to generic XML file, containing document nodes with properties in the form of attributes and text/data
 as a content of the node. The XML parsing is supported by most of languages popular libraries, therefor it won't be
 problematic to process data further. On the other hand this does not apply to *.rst files, which have many parsers but
 it is not as common as the XML files.
 Finally, while having the content data in the XML format (files stored in directories representing parts of web page)
 we will use the "html template" file for conversion between XML and HTML.

<!-- General rules for the "HTML Template"
 There are 2 types of html document elements. First is a regular document element, which will be converted "as is" with
 injected extra content defined in rst files (the files storing pure data in a form of text and its declarative attributes).
 The template html file might also include JS files to operate on the document the same way as simple web page.

 The second type of element is the definition. The definition element will not be rendered where is placed, it is just
 used for describing how to build html representation of the given document object. It can reference some properties
 related to given object and place properties values into text (content) of html document node.
 Note, if some some document object would not be defined inside html template the one from the parent directory
 would be used or if none would be found the default built-in would be used.

<!-- Global Document Properties

<!-- define
 everything under "define" attribute will not be rendered directly. The defined html document node will be used for
 building view of specified document object, here the "note" object. The put-start/put-end attribute informs to put as
 node content specified property(which might also be composition of rendered other doc. objects) from the "note" object.
 To know all the properties of object you need to look for some documentation of the "note" object.
 Note, that put-start/end references local property name, valid for the "note" object that is being processed. To
 reference a global, document wide property, use "global <property name>" syntax
